# simple-discord-bot
this is a simple discord bot I'm making, it will be subject to many changes so feel free to make any new branches you want.
This bot has two files; a main bot file and a compliments file which just contains a python list of many compliments feel free to change the way the compliments are importet but I couldn't find a free API for compliments.
Here is the video I used to first start the bot and to host it.
